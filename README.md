This is a repository that houses things we built to collaborate with other developers, tinkerers, innovators and builders in El Salvador to create Open-Source Bitcoin mining hardware and fun stuff. The Bitaxe featured is this El Salvador themed modified Bitaxe 204, with modifications to the screen and minor adjustments. Also included in this repo are some fun volcano and El Salvador-themed 3D printable accessories, like a "By Hand" jig to help Bitaxe builders secure their Bitaxe while applying components, and a volcano-themed Bitaxe stand along with a fun Volcano Disk. Enjoy!
